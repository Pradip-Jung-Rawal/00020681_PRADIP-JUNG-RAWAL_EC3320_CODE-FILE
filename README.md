“University Recommendation System using Machine Learning (KNN + Content-Based Filtering). A full web-based project that helps students find suitable universities based on preferences such as location, program, tuition fees, and facilities.”

This project is a University Recommendation System developed as part of my Final Year IT Project. 
It uses a hybrid Machine Learning approach combining K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF) 
to recommend the most suitable universities to students based on their preferences.

The system evaluates multiple parameters such as program type, tuition fees, country, ranking, 
acceptance rate, research opportunities, and facilities. It includes a machine learning backend, 
a web-based user interface, and a custom-built dataset of 3000+ universities worldwide.

This repository contains all project files including dataset, ML models, source code, 
documentation, and deployment instructions.
